=========================

This is the source code of Plastic Yet Still In-Between, a web-based group exhibition (Pavilion) created for The Wrong Biennale 2013.  The combination of WebGL 3D navigation, 2D jQuery/CSS stuff, and interactions with embedded media should hopefully provide a good example for anyone working within this overlap.  The main WebGL loop and initialization is in the index.html file, with a lot of the prototypes and functions in the files inside the "js" directory.
